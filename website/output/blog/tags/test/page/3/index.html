compiles and does everything you would have ever wanted well then look
further (go see Linux). But if you want to build your own OS including
booting, switching to PM etcetera etcetera, then this is the place to
be!</p>

<p>Recently I started my own attempt at writing an OS, well you can't
exactly call it that right now, it only boots from a floppy and switches
to Protected Mode right now, but that was hard enough to figure out.</p>

<p>Although there is a lot of info on the net concerning PM, boot sectors,
BIOS and all, I have yet to find a place where all this stuff is treated
step by step (and explained as well).</p>

<p>The following sections are an attempt to guide you through the pitfalls
(especially switching to Protected Mode) of booting from a floppy drive,
switching to protected mode and loading a kernel (a very simple one).</p>

<p>As my own project will progress I will try to take you along with me. So
the order in which subjects are treated is probably not the most logical
or most educational but it happens to be the order in which I stumbled
(or better fell and broke a leg :-)) across things.</p>

<p>I hope this will help you in finding the right path (a well at least a
path) through the slippery stuff called OS-programming and that you will
have fun doing it. If you have any comments, suggestions or burning
questions or if you want to point out some terrible mistakes I made,
please feel free to contact me.</p>

<h2>Things you should know or have to get started</h2>

<p>It is assumed you have a Pentium computer at your disposal (though a
lot of stuff will work on a 386 as well). Further I use The Netwide
Assembler, <a href="http://www.nasm.us/">NASM</a> for short, because it's ease of
use (much more logical than MASM or TASM in my humble opinion), because
everybody else uses it and because it is FREE (well you're from Holland
or you're not :-)). Last but not least you have to be a little insane
;-) (Thanx to Raphael Gray for pointing out this very important
prerequisite) Further more I assume you have the best debugger of all
time, debug.exe (included in windows and dos) &quot;installed&quot; on your
system. Well guess that's all so let's get dirty. And start with that
magical process called booting.</p>

<h2>Booting the PC and the boot sector</h2>

<p>When you switch on your computer, program execution starts at memory
location <code>F000:FFF0</code>. (this is a real mode address, if you don't get that
right now, don't worry I will get to that when I discuss Protected Mode,
and it isn't that important anyway.) This memory location is part of the
ROM-BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) which is installed in all IBM
compatibles. The computer then starts executing a routine called the
POST (Power On Self Test) which checks if a keyboard is plugged in, if
the CMOS OK and that kind of stuff. Not very interesting from an
OS-programmer's point of view. But the last action the POST takes is
looking for a bootable disk. Hey this gets more interesting!</p>

<p>The BIOS checks your drives in the order which is defined in your
BIOS-SETUP. (when we start testing some boot disks we'll be booting from
a floppy drive, so make sure your BIOS checks your flops first) But how
does it know that a disk is bootable? Simple a bootable disk has the
signature 0AA55h (h=hexadecimal) in the last two bytes (that is 55h in
the second last and AAh in the last byte because of the Endian byte
ordering in the x86 family). If this signature is found, sector 0 (the
boot sector which is 200h=512 bytes big) is loaded in memory at location
0000:7C00h and control is transferred to this address. Well that wasn't
so hard, was it ? So lets try to write or own boot sector which only
displays:</p>

<pre><code>NO BOOT DISK</code></pre>

<p>and then totally freezes. (to keep it simple) Here we go:</p>

<pre><code>;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
; dumbboot.asm

   mov ax, 0
   mov es, ax                      ;point es to the segment of the boot message
   mov cx, MessageLength

   mov ax,01301h                   ;Function 13h (ax=13h) Attribute in bl (al = 01h)
   mov bx,0007h                    ;screen page 0 (bh=0)  white on black (bl=07h)
   mov dx,0                        ;start in left corner
   mov bp, BootMessage             ;takes offset of BootMessage (no offset keyword, GREAT!)
   int 10h                         ;display the string

   spin: jmp short  spin           ;go into an infinite loop

   times 510-($-$$) db 0           ;fill with zeroes until byte 510 of the boot sector
                                   ;See NASM doc for more info on $ and $$)
   dw 0xAA55                       ;write boot signature (actually goes in memory as 55h AAh)</code></pre>

<p>Got that? Well lets compile it using <a href="http://www.nasm.us/">NASM</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>nasm dumbboot.asm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gives a file called &quot;dumbboot&quot; which an exact binary picture so no
headers. Now type (assuming you use A:)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>debug dumbboot - w 100 0 0 1 - q</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writes your homemade bootsector to A:. (to use B: type w 100 1 0 1)
Now reboot your PC and TADA we've grabbed control, isn't that great?</p>

<h2>The DOS boot sector</h2>

<p>The previous boot sector has one big problem. DOS won't recognize the
disk anymore. So if we would want to put a new bootsector at the disk,
debug gives a write error, because it hasn't got a clue wat type of disk
it is.</p>

<p>Well, how does DOS know what kind of disk is inserted? Very simple, on
the bootsector there are some reserved fields which tell DOS what kind
of disk it is. And because our previous bootsector uses those fields to
store code, DOS can't handle the disk anymore. So let's fix that! The
fields in the bootsector are defined as follows:</p>

<h3>DOS boot sector layout</h3>

<pre><code>&gt;   Offset     Field description                                                      Length of field

&gt;   1Ah        Number of read/write heads                                             1 word
&gt;   1Ch        Number of hidden sectors                                               1 word

<p>OK that seems pretty straightforward, so let's try to put it to
practice. In the following piece of code I am assuming you use a 3,5&quot; HD
disk.</p>

<p>OK now reformat your boot disk (format a: /u) compile dosboot.asm and
write it to the bootsector of your bootdisk, just as you did before.</p>

<p>This disk can now again be used as a normal DOS disk, you can view it
and put files on it, but when you boot from it, it still displays NO
BOOT DISK, try it!</p>

<p>I hope these two sections gave you some feel of the boot process and the
boot sector. If you want more information check out Michael Tischer's
book. OK please go to the toilet, take a snack, drink some coffee and
then read on because we're going to look at Protected Mode!</p>

<h2>Protected Mode, what is it all about?</h2>

<p>Although through the years most PC's have been equiped with more and
more memory, all DOS programs still had to deal with the infamous 640 KB
limit. Why wasn't it possible to access all those MB's you had installed
on your system? Because even the newest processor had to be able to
execute the 8086's code it had to operate in the same way. This means
you only had 20-bit addresses giving a total accessible memory of
$2^20 = 1MB$, even if you had 40 MB plugged in your system. On a pentium
however we have a 32-bits wide address bus which gives a theoretical
address space of $2^32 = 4GB$!</p>

<p>How can we access al this additional memory. Well we have to leave the
8086's real mode and switch to the incredible Protected Mode. Do you
want a codesegment of 4 GB? Do you want to put the entire Encyclopedia
Brittanica in your datasegment? Well just do it, switch to Protected
Mode (PM) and you've got access to all the memory you would ever want.</p>

<h2>How the PC behaves in real mode</h2>

<p>When you reboot the PC it enters a mode known as real mode. This mode
gives maximum compatibility with the 8086 and some extra features (such
as extended registers, faster instructions ,additional instructions etc.
etc.).</p>

<p>In this mode memory is divided in segments of 64 KB (16 bits) with a
total addressable space of $2^20=1024KB$. Memory locations are accessed
through a segment:offset address (the so called <em>logical address</em>).
Calculation of the <em>physical address</em> (the actual byte number in memory)
is performed in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>physical address = 10h*segment+offset
</code></pre>

<p>For example if we take segment 9000h and offset 8000h (logical address
9000:8000h) we get physical address
<code>9000h*10h+8000h = 90000h + 8000h = 98000h</code>. (Note that this address
refers to the same physical memory location as for instance 9300:5000h
so segments overlap in real mode) To access different segments, 16-bit
segment registers (such as cs, ds and es) are used so that the maximum
address is $FFFF:000Fh = FFFFFh physical = 2^20$.</p>

<p>The maximal address accessable address would be FFFF:FFFFh = 10FFEFh
physical, but this can't be expressed in 20 bits. However if we find a
way to access an additional address line (the most famous A20 line) we
can even use this additional FFFF:FFFFh-FFFF:000Fh=FFF0h=65520 bytes.
(the so called High Memory Area (HMA)) But why do we have to enable this
A20 line? Why isn't it enabled at boot up?</p>

<p>If the A20 line would be enabled then if we got the highest 20 bit
address FFFF:000Fh = FFFFFh and we would go one byte further
(FFFF:0010h) we would access the physical address 100000h (1 0000 0000
0000 0000 0000b), however at the 8086 there is no A20 (this is the 21st
addressline because we start at A0) so that FFFF:000Fh+1= 0000:0000h
dropping the carry. Because some programs use this memory wrap feature
on the 8086, the A20 has to be disabled for complete backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>There is however a way to enable this A20 address line (this is what
himem.sys does on MS-DOS computers giving an additional memoryblock of
almost 64K for device drivers and so on). We can use the keyboard
controller to enable this A20 line, because the A20 line is logical
ANDed with a keyboard controller output, which is disabled at boot up.
This means that the 21st bit of an address is always: 0 AND x = 0. So
all we have to do is enable this keyboard controller output to get: 1
AND x = x. (code to do this will be presented in a later chapter)
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Now how can we access A31-A22 to get the 4 GB addressable memory space?
You guessed it, by switching to protected mode. However in PM, memory
management is quite a different ballplay so let's check it out.</p>

<h2>How the PC behaves in Protected Mode</h2>

<h3>Segmentation in Protected Mode</h3>

<p>In PM segmentation is performed in quite a different manner. Here a
segmentregister (CS, DS, ES FS, GS or SS) contains a <em>segment selector</em>
which is a pointer to a <em>segment descriptor</em> in the <em>Global or Local
Descriptor Table (GDT or LDT)</em></p>

<p>The segment descriptor (64 bits) contains information about the segment,
like access rights, size, and base address. Let's take a look at a
segment descriptors fields</p>

<p>Let's take a look at all those fields in a bit more detail.</p>

<ul>
<li>A: this bit is available for your own use, for instance to create
your own virtual memory manager.</li>
<li>Base: this is the base address of the segment. Because it's 32 bits
long, a segment can start on any physical memory place (not just at
64K borders as in real mode) if this field contains for instance
5555:0000h, then this segment will start at physical
address 55550000h. (so no multiplication with 10h as in real mode)
However with speed in mind it is wise to let a segment start on a
16-byte boundary.</li>
<li>DB: This field performs different functions depending on the
segment Type. This flag is always 1 for 32-bit code and data
segments and 0 for 16-bit code and data segments.</li>
<li>DPL: These two bits give the privilege level of the segment ranging
from 0 (highest privilege) to 3 (lowest privilege). This flag is
used to control access to a segment.</li>
<li>Limit: Gives the size of the segment. Although it's only 20 bits
long, a segment can be 4 GB long this is achieved by setting the
G bit.</li>
<li>G: If this bit is set the actual segment size is the limit times 4
KB ($1MB * 4K = 4 GB$), if this flag is clear the size of the
segment is the limit in bytes. So for segments bigger than 1 MB the
size must be a mutiple of 4 KB, but this is no real restriction.</li>
<li>P: This flag indicates whether the segment is present in memory
(set) or not present (clear). If this flag is clear the processor
generates an segment not present exception (#NP) when a segment
selector that points to the segment descriptor is loaded in a
segment register. When we are not using virtual memory or paging
this flag is usually set.</li>
<li>S: Specifies a system segment (clear) or a code or data
segment (set).</li>
<li>Type: Indicates the segment type (note that bits 10-8 have different
names depending on bit 11 (code or data)) :

<p>Because we would like to access a number of segments, we will need a lot
of segment descriptors (especially in a multi-tasking Operating System).
Therefore we make a table of segment descriptors know as the Global
Discriptor Table.</p>

<h3>The Global Descriptor Table</h3>

<p>The global descriptor table (GDT) is a part of the memory where segment
descriptors are defined. The first descriptor is located at the memory
location which is loaded in the &lt;b&gt;Global Descriptor Table
Register (GDTR)&lt;/b&gt;, this is a 48-bit register containing the
address of the GDT (32 bits) and the length of the GDT in bytes (16
bits) so there can be 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; / 8 = 8192 descriptors
in the GDT. The first descriptor in the GDT must be the so called
&lt;b&gt;null descriptor&lt;/b&gt;. This descriptor consists only of
zeroes. And although this isn't used by the system, it can be loaded to
any data-segment register (DS, ES, FS and GS) without generating an
exception. Let's look at an example of a GDT:</p>

<p>Let's look at the <em>Basic Flat Model</em>. This means that we have two
segments of 4 GB, a code and a data segment, which completely overlap in
memory. (So it is still possible, though not advisable, to write self
modifying code):</p>

   dd gdt                          ;linear, physical address of gdt

<p>Now we have seen how to set up code and data segments it would be nice
to see how we can access these segments, this is done by loading segment
selectors in segment register. &lt;a name=&quot;select&quot;&gt;</p>

<h3>Segment Selectors</h3>

<p>A segment selector is a 16-bit value used to select a segment in the
GDT. First let's take a look at the segment selector's format:</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Segment selector overview&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td align=&quot;CENTER&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;pre&gt; 16 3 2 1 0
---------------------------------------- | Index | T | RPL |
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Index: this is the index of the segment
to be used in the GDT or LDT. In our previous example of a GDT, the null
selector would have an index of 0h, the code segment selector an index
of 1h and so on. I guess this is the actual reason why there can only be
8192 selectora. (the index field is 13 bits wide and
2&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; = 8192 = 2000h) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TI: this
tells the processor whether the descriptor should be taken out of de GDT
or the LDT (Local Descriptor Table, this table can be defined for every
seperate process in a multitasking environment). In our case TI = 0 so
that we'll use the GDT. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RPL: The requested
privilege level must be smaller or equal to the descriptor privilege
level (so higher or same priority) to be able to access the segment. If
this is not the case a general protection exception will be generated
(#GP). In our case we'll use RPL = 0. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>

<p>Assume we would want to access the datasegment from the GDT, with RPL =
0. We would then have to load for example DS with 10h (0000 0000 0000
1000b). If we now want to place a white on black 'a' (character code
041h color attribute 07h) in the first place of the video memory we
could say:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>mov word [0xB8000],0x0741&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>We could also load for instance gs with 18h (selecting the videosegment)
and say:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>mov word [gs:0],0x741 ;remember segment-base = 0xB8000 so offset =
0h&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>Now the only thing left mentioning is how to set up the GDTR. Well
luckely there is a special instruction which does this for us:
&lt;b&gt;lgdt (Load Global descriptor table)&lt;/b&gt;. The limit loaded
in the GDTR is an offset to the last valid byte, so a limit of 0 results
in exactly one valid byte. So if we would want to load the GDTR in our
case the limit would be gdt_end-gdt-1, because the label gdt_end is
one byte after the last byte of the GDT, which is exactly what I've put
at label gdtr. The base address of our GDT will be 0000:16-bit offset of
gdt, or simpler just gdt. Again I have put that there. So all we have to
do is load the GDTR with the value specified at gdt:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>o32 lgdt [gdtr]&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>o32 is a NASM keyword which tells the assembler that our operator size
prefix is 32-bit, I don't know whether this is absolutely necessary.
(any suggestions?) &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>This is all we need to know about memory access in PM for the moment.
Now the time has come to do the actual switch.</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Switching from real to Protected
Mode&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;b&gt;The operation mode of the
processor is controlled by the least significant bit of the 32-bit
control register 0 (CR0), also called the protection enable (PE)
bit.&lt;/b&gt; Because it's paramount to leave the other bits unchanged
this is done in the following way:</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mov eax,cr0 ;load eax with the contents of cr0 or
eax,1 ;set the least significant bit leave the other bits unchanged mov
cr0,eax ;switch to PM &lt;/pre&gt;</p>

<p>Before switching to PM, there are a few things you need to do:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;cli: Disable interrupts, because the
installed interrupts are all written for real mode and if an interrupt
would occur after the mode switch, your system would probably reboot.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load the GDTR using lgdt, to set up the GDT.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute a mov CR0 instruction to set the PE bit of
control register 0. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immediately after the mov,cr0
instruction perform a far jump to clear the instruction prefetch queue,
because it's still filled with real mode instructions and addresses.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reload all the segment registers except CS. (which
is reloaded by the far jump) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Load the Interrupt
descriptor tables to make interrupts possible &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sti:
Re-enable interrupts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enable the A20 line to
prevent memorywrap. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>In the following source, I am only going to load the GDT and switch to
PM. So I will not set up a stack or an IDT, which is fine as long as you
don't POP or PUSH and leave interrupts disabled. When you boot this
example the following actions will be taken:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The screen will be erased.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A brown 'a' will be printed in the left corner of
the screen. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The system will wait for a keypress.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The switch to PM will be made.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A white 'a' will be printed in the left corner of
the screen. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The system will go into an infinite
loop (note that CTRL+ALT+DEL will no longer function, because interrupts
are still disabled). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Enable the A20 address
line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/center&gt;In order to use the full amount of RAM
plugged in your computer you have to enable the a20 addressline. As
mentioned earlier this can be done by enabling a line of the floppy
controller. The state of this line can be changed by setting the
appropriate bit. This bit is the second bit of the AT keyboard
controller output port. (port 064h) So in theory we can enable the a20
address line by simply setting this second bit.</p>

<p>There are however some things to be taken into account. The keyboard
buffer (that is the buffer on the keyboard, not the BIOS-buffer) can
still contain some bytes which have to be handled first. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>If we have completly cleared the keyboard buffer we try to set the a20
line. This should then enable us to use the additional 64K HMA. So we
can test whether the a20 gate is enabled by writing a byte to
FFFF:000Fh+1 and check whether this byte is different from the one at
0000:0001h. Because if a20 is enabled FFFF:000Fh+1=100000h physical and
if a20 is not enabled a wrap will occur thus writing a byte to 000000h
physical. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>To be able to see if the byte positioned at the physical address 00000h
has really changed we try to write the bit inverted (by using NOT) byte
of the original value of 00000h. In that manner it's always possible to
see if 00000h has changed (which would imply that a20 is not enabled).
&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The code I have used below is not written by me. (although I have added
some comments) I think Tran originally wrote this code for use in his
PMode protected mode wrapper. The piece of code conains a function
EnableA20 which should do exactly that. So here we go: &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<pre><code>enablea20kbwait:                      ;wait for safe to write to 8042

<p>As you can see it requires quite a few lines of assembly to enable the
a20 gate. This can pose a problem because a bootsector can only be a
maximum 512 bytes. (And we still have to add code to load our kernel en
place it in memory) &lt;/p&gt; In order to make some room we will remove
the layout area DOS uses to identify the disk. This forces us to write a
program by which we can write a file to the bootsector of our bootdisk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Writing a bootsector to a non-DOS
disk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/center&gt;In contrast to all those lucky linux-users
who have dd at their disposal, a DOS or Windows user doesn't have an
easy way of writing a binary image to a floppy if it is not recognizable
by DOS. Because our bootsector is getting a bit full I really wanted to
remove the block with diskinfo DOS uses to recognize the disk. The
problem is that it's then impossible to use debug to write the
bootsector to the floppy. So I decided to write my very own WBS (Write
BootSector).</p>

<p>So what has to be done to write an arbitrary file to the bootsector of a
floppy disk? First of all the bootimage has to be read from the hard
disk and stored in memory. Then the buffer containing the bootsector has
to be written to the floppy disk.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
